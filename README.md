# HungerGame
A role-play game about managing a country's financial decisions and minimizing hunger!

We recommend reading our [Player Manual](https://github.com/m7yash/HungerGame/blob/0385cd296509951b48202f8a7a053429e4c5db68/HUNGER-PlayerManual.pdf) â€“ the math you need to think about to win the game is somewhat complex.

This game was devloped by Yash Mishra, Edward Zhang, Ashwath Srikanth, and Joshua Chow.
