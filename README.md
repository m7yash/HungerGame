# HungerGame
A role-play game about managing a country's financial decisions and minimizing hunger!

We recommend reading our [Player Manual](https://github.com/m7yash/HungerGame/blob/0385cd296509951b48202f8a7a053429e4c5db68/HUNGER-PlayerManual.pdf) â€“ the math you need to think about to win the game is somewhat complex.

This game was made in collaboration with 3 other students at my university (University of Washington) in 2021.

# How To Play
- Download ```Hunger.py``` and whichever client you want to use
  - To play with graphics, download and run the Tk Client (note: you may need to run ```pip3 install Pillow``` to use this). The command is ```python3 Tk_SOLUZION_Client3.py```.
  - To play without graphics, download and run the Text Client. The command is ```python3 Text_SOLUZION_Client.py```.
