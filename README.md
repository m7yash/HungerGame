# HungerGame
A role-play game about managing a country's financial decisions and minimizing hunger!
We recommend reading our Player Manual â€“ the math you need to think about to win the game is somewhat complex.
To play with graphics, run the Tk Client. To play without graphics, use the Text Client.
This game was made in collaboration with 3 other students at my university (University of Washington). We used Scrum framework for development.
